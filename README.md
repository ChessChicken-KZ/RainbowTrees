# RainbowTrees

A StationAPI mod that adds 16 colour trees to your minecraft world!

## Setup
For setup instructions, please refer to [stationapi-example-mod page](https://github.com/calmilamsy/stationapi-example-mod).

There is no Fabric-API for beta 1.7.3, so this mod uses [StationAPI](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI).
